# Android-Chip-Extractor
Rimworld addon mod for Android Tiers by Atlas
Adds an item called android chip extractor to the game. Can be built at the Android Parts table for a lower cost than producing a new VX2 Chip.
Pretty much a better alternative to crafting a new chip if you have dead bodies with a chip inside them.
Small chance of corruption on androids, and higher chance on organic lifeforms.
